API Reference
=============

All Verta functionality can be accessed via our APIs.
The Verta API functionality can be broken into four parts:

* Core APIs: used to establish connections to the Verta servers and manage authentication
* Versioning and Metadata APIs: used to version models and manage metadata
* Deployment and Release APIs: used to package, deploy, and release models
* Monitoring APIs: used to monitor systems and data metrics
