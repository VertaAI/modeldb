Sharing and collaboration
=========================

Once a project or any other resource has been created, it can be shared with
others for review and collaboration.

Adding individual collaborators
-------------------------------

To share projects, datasets, and more, other users can be added as
collaborators through the web app. Once added, those users can access the
resource via the web app and the client, and permissions of each collaborator
can be specified through the **settings** tab.

Adding teams
------------

If a resource is created within an organization, it can also be shared with an
entire `team <organizations/manage_teams.html>`__ at once:
