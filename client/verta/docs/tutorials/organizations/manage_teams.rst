Managing teams
==============

A team is a subset of the members of your organization that can share a single level of access. This
simplifies controlling access based on which teams individuals belong to.

Creating a new team
-------------------

You can create a team just like creating an organization:

Any member of the organization can be added to the teams, just like
`adding them to the organization <manage_members.html>`_. Note that only people already inside
the organization can be invited to its teams.
