Access through the client
=========================

Once an organization is created, it can be used to organize access to projects,
datasets, and more.

Verta allows these resources to be contained within organizationsâ€”using the
client.

Client and workspaces
---------------------

To specify what organization an resource should be in, methods of
:class:`~verta.client.Client` provide a ``workspace`` parameter where
applicable. For example, to create a project in an organization called
"tutorial":

.. code-block:: python

    client.create_project("Text Classification", workspace="tutorial")

After creation, the project can get retrieved from that workspace:

.. code-block:: python

    client.get_project("Text Classification", workspace="tutorial")

.. image:: /_static/gifs/tutorial-orgs-access.gif
    :width: 90%
    :align: center

By default, these resources are private and need to be
`shared <../sharing.html>`__ with other users in order to enable
collaboration. Client methods also provide a ``public_within_org`` parameter to
make the resource accessible to the entire organization upon creation:

.. code-block:: python

    client.create_project("Image Classification", workspace="tutorial", public_within_org=True)
