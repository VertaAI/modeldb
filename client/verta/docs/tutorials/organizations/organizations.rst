Organizations
=============

Organizations within the Verta platform help you manage access to resources while facilitating
collaboration. You can start by `creating an organization <create_organization.html>`_, which then
allows you to:

* `Manage members <manage_members.html>`_ to control visibility;
* `Manage teams <manage_teams.html>`_ to facilitate collaboration and handle access control;
* `Manage default permissions <manage_permissions.html>`_ of resources that belong to the organization.

.. note::

    You can integrate your identity provider to automatically define organizations and teams based
    on an external management tool. Please contact the Verta team at
    `support@verta.ai <mailto:support@verta.ai>`_ for adding this feature to your deployment.
