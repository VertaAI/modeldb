Managing default permissions
============================

Controlling the level of access for each resource that belongs to an organization might be tedious
and burdensome.

Verta allows you to set a default level of permissions for all members of the organization.

Controlling the visibility
--------------------------

When creating a resource inside an organization, you can select the visibility level it will have.
The following screenshot shows an example of creating a project:

    :width: 800px
    :align: center

If the permission level is private, then access is provided only based on who is a collaborator in
the resource, and no organization member except for the organization owner and the resource owner
will be able to view the resource.

If the permission level is the default, then the resource will automatically be exposed to all
members of the organization. The organization owner can control the level of access that members have.

Setting level of permission
---------------------------

The organization owner can control the level of access for each resource that is public within the
organization.

These permissions are the same as the collaborator system. This means that every member of the
organization is automatically a collaborator to your resources!
