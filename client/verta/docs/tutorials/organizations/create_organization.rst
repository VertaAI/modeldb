Creating an organization
========================

Sometimes it's easier to manage projects and people by grouping them. An organization allows you to
share permissions and visibility settings for such groups.

Listing organizations
---------------------

You can list your organizations via the WebApp by clicking on your personal menu and selecting
"Organizations", like this:

.. image:: /_static/images/tutorial-orgs-list.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

Each organization will tell if you're an owner or just a member, and give actions such as leave the
organization.

Creating an organization
------------------------

If the organization you want doesn't currently exist, then you can create one via the button in the
list page or via a direct button in the workspace menu:

.. TODO: add link to workspaces

.. image:: /_static/images/tutorial-orgs-create.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

This will open a page to fill out the details of your organization and you should be good to go!
