Deployment
==========

After the models are trained, it must be deployed for downstream consumption. Verta's Endpoint provides a configurable API for deploying machine learning models.

The following tutorials will walk you through the entire process of using an endpoint, from creation and retrieval to updating and making query to it.

* `Creating and retrieving an endpoint <endpoint_creation.html>`_.
* `Updating an endpoint <endpoint_update.html>`_
* `Updating an endpoint with canary strategy <endpoint_canary_update.html>`_.
* `Querying an endpoint <endpoint_query.html>`_.
