Deployment
==========

After the models are trained and packaged, it can be deployed for downstream consumption.

The following tutorials will walk you through the entire process of using an endpoint, Verta's configurable API for deploying machine learning models:

* `Creating and retrieving an endpoint <endpoint_creation.html>`_.
* `Updating an endpoint <endpoint_update.html>`_
* `Updating an endpoint with canary strategy <endpoint_canary_update.html>`_.
* `Querying an endpoint <endpoint_query.html>`_.
