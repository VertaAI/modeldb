Creating custom users
=====================

A new team member can be registered directly through the web app as a custom
user.

.. note::

    Not all deployments offer custom users; please contact the Verta team at
    `support@verta.ai <mailto:support@verta.ai>`_ for more information about
    this feature.

Signing up through the web app
------------------------------

Custom users can be created via the web app's login page, which can be accessed
by either first logging out or by visiting the web app in an incognito window.
The **Sign Up** link will open a form for a new user to be created.

Once created, the user can immediately `get started <../quickstart.html>`__
with using the platform.
