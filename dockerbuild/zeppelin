# a sample configuration file. To make Zeppelin actually use this file, we'll
# copy it into conf/zeppelin-site.xml.

# the port should be 8080. This is indicated by the line <value>8080</value>
# in the conf/zeppelin-site.xml. We'll change this line to <value>8082</value>.
# It's a bit hacky, but it should work.
